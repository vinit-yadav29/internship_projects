# TF-IDF Text Summarizer

This project is a simple and effective extractive text summarizer built using Python. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to identify the most important sentences in a given piece of text and generate a concise summary.

Features:
- Tokenizes and cleans text using nltk
- Removes stopwords and applies stemming
- Scores sentences using TF-IDF
- Selects top N most relevant sentences as a summary
- Saves the model/vectorizer using pickle
- Basic evaluation using precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Example Output:
Given a paragraph about data science, the summarizer might generate something like:

=== Extractive Summary ===

Data scientists use tools such as Python, R, SQL, and machine learning algorithms to build predictive models and uncover hidden patterns.
In industries like healthcare, finance, marketing, and transportation, data science is transforming how organizations operate and deliver value.
However, working with data also requires ethical considerations, such as ensuring privacy, avoiding bias, and maintaining transparency.

What's Inside:
- notebook.ipynb – The full code for text summarization (written in Jupyter Notebook)
- tfidf_summarizer.pkl – Serialized TF-IDF vectorizer and sentence data
- requirements.txt – Required Python libraries

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tfidf-text-summarizer.git
   cd tfidf-text-summarizer

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Launch the notebook:
   jupyter notebook

Required Libraries:
nltk==3.8.1
numpy==1.26.4
scikit-learn==1.4.2
notebook>=6.5.0   # if using Jupyter Notebook

You can also install them manually:
pip install nltk numpy scikit-learn notebook

Don’t forget to download the required NLTK data in the notebook:
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')

Future Improvements:
- Use lemmatization instead of stemming
- Integrate spaCy for better linguistic preprocessing
- Add support for TextRank or transformer-based summarizers
- Build a Streamlit or Gradio-based web interface
